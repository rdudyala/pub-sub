Dynamic Pipeline-Agent Module:
1.Packages :
        pika
        yaml
        subprocess
        logging
        operator
        json
        ConfigParser

  -> pip install pika
 Remaing packages will come by default with OS package or can be installed
 using command
 -> sudo apt-get <package-name>

2.Files:
a. utils.py: Consists of utility function for parsing and updating pipeline.yaml
b. pipeline.yaml:Sample pipeline.yaml file with minimum source and sink information tags,
c. pipeline.py: Does validation of pipeline.yaml configuration.
d. pipeline_agent.py: Main file of the module while will listen on Rabbitmq exchange "pubsub"
e. pipeline_agent.conf : Conf file should consist of the following information:
                       i.Rabbitmq server datails(host,port,username,passwd)

f. README

3.To run the module:
  ->sudo python pipeline_agent.py

4.Format to send conf msg to the module:
  i.For updating conf :
    -> msg={"sub_info":sub_info,"target":target,"action":"ADD"}
  ii.for deleting conf :
    -> msg={"sub_info":sub_info,"target":target,"action":"DEL"}

     The above two msgs should be in json fomrat and should send to same rabbitmq-server where pipeline_agent.py is running
     with "pubsub"  exchage.
     ex:
        sub_info  = ["cpu_util", "memory"]
        target = "kafka://1.2.3.2:18"
